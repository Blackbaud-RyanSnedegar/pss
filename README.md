## pss

Most default memory tools on linux show the Rss and Vss (resident and virtual set sizes).  These are usually sufficient to grasp what's happening, but on occasion you will want to also know the Pss (proportional).  This tool returns the pss size.  


Usage:
```pss string 

or

pss pid1 [pid2 pid3 ...]
```

### roadmap

add rss and vss as optional output.
